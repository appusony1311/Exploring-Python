Pandas is an open-source, BSD-licensed Python library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. Python with Pandas is used in a wide range of fields including academic and commercial domains including finance, economics, Statistics, analytics, etc. In this tutorial, we will learn the various features of Python Pandas and how to use them in practice.


The pandas package is the most important tool at the disposal of Data Scientists and Analysts working in Python today. The powerful machine learning and glamorous visualization tools may get all the attention, but pandas is the backbone of most data projects.

Pandas is built on top of the NumPy package, meaning a lot of the structure of NumPy is used or replicated in Pandas. Data in pandas is often used to feed statistical analysis in SciPy, plotting functions from Matplotlib, and machine learning algorithms in Scikit-learn.


The primary two components of pandas are the Series and DataFrame.
A Series is essentially a column, and a DataFrame is a multi-dimensional table made up of a collection of Series.


What is Python Pandas?

Pandas is used for data manipulation, analysis and cleaning. Python pandas is well suited for different kinds of data, such as: 

    Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns
    Ordered and unordered time series data
    Arbitrary matrix data with row & column labels
    Unlabelled data
    Any other form of observational or statistical data sets

Slicing the Data Frame

In order to perform slicing on data, you need a data frame. Don’t worry, data frame is a 2-dimensional data structure and a most common pandas object. So first, let’s create a data frame.
